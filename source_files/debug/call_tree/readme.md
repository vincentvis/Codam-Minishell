# Create a call tree

Heavily inspired by [`etrace`](http://ndevilla.free.fr/etrace/)

Compile:
`make calltree`

Run program:
`./minishell` with whatever you want

Close the program with `cmd+D` or `exit`

Run from project home directory
`node ./source_files/debug/call_tree/call_tree_parse.js`

Should log a function call tree to STDOUT
